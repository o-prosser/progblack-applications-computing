#Interest of content

The content is interesting and relevant, but there is not much of it.

#Consistency and quality of visual presentation

There is a consistent blue theme and the pages are visually pleasing, but there could be more consistency in the styling elements other than colour.

#Quality of written presentation

There were no obvious spelling or grammar errors

#Validity of HTML

The HTML is functioning well and we could not see any errors

#Evidence of collaboration

There is a balanced contribution between members, but since the pages appear differently it does not seem like there has been much collaboration or standadisation.
